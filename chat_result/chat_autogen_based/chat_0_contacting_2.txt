As a research assistant, you will receive a stipend to cover living expenses and may also receive tuition waiver.  2. **Scholarships**: We offer several scholarships to support graduate students based on academic merit, research potential, or financial need. These scholarships can cover all or part of your tuition and fees.  3. **External Grants and Fellowships**: We encourage our graduate students to apply for external grants and fellowships from organizations such as the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and other private foundations. These can provide significant funding for your research and education.  4. **University and Departmental Funding**: Our university and department offer various funding opportunities for graduate students, including research grants, travel grants, and conference support.  5. **Teaching Assistantships**: If you are interested in teaching, you may be eligible for a teaching assistantship, which provides a stipend and tuition waiver in exchange for teaching duties.
